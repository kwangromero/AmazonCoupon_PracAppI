# Github repository description
Includes a Jupyter Notebook that details the characteristics of customers who accept bar and coffee-house coupons to help determine 
if sending coupons to drivers are effective.
Also includes the coupons.csv file which contains the dataset of customers who either accept or reject coupons sent to them along 
with other customer characteristics that may play a role in the customer's ultimate decision to either accept or reject a coupon.

# Summary of findings: bar coupons
About 81% of customers who accepted bar coupons do not go to bars often (less than 3 times a month) and the people who do accept
bar coupons tend to not have kids as a passenger.

# Summary of findings: coffee house coupons
The characteristics of customers who accept coffee house coupons are:
1. more often making <50K a year
2. are more often a student, in the computer & mathematical industry, or are unemployed
3. willing to drive more than 5 minutes to use their coffee house coupon but less than 25 minutes
4. typically, lone drivers would buy a coffee to go to work or home. Otherwise, customers typically would buy coffee if they had
 passengers and no urgent destination place
 ## next steps and recommendations
 1. make sure to send out coupons of coffee houses that are nearby the driver (between 5-15 minutes away from driver)
 2. because a lot of students drink coffee, it could be wise to send out coupons to a coffee house that is on the university campus
